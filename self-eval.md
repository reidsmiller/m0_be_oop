# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? 
This last CFU was certainly a challenge, but it was really fun. I had a blast. The bat problem really stumped me for a long time, had to take a break and go on a walk and come back. But ultimately I got everything and feel good about it.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
So far so good! I was nervous if I would really be able to stay on track at home and how much I would like/dislike it, but I've been having fun! I really enjoyed mod 0 so far.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I think I feel pretty good about it all honestly! This was a fun week! I will definitely make use of the study halls.
